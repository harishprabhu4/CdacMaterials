CREATE TABLE
 - with out constrains

CONSTRATINS
 - is used to specify the rule
   that allows or restricts what values /data will be stored in the table

constrains can also be alter using alter table

CREATE TABLE Student
(  
  sid int not null,  
  sname varchar(20),  
  subject varchar(10),  
  marks int

- not null can be applied more than one field

CREATE TABLE Student
(  
  sid int unique,  
  sname varchar(20),  
  subject varchar(10),  
  marks int  
); 
- not null can be applied more than one field
- it will allow null

primary key
- is the combination of not null , unicque
- it wont allow dublicate
- uniquely identifies each row

-refential integrity
-parent child relation 
-point to primary key of another table

drop contraint stu_cour_fk from course;

- if you set the forgien key (cid)
- parent child relation
- if no data in parent
  it wont allow to insert record of cid
  if it is not exist in parent- cid

- you cannot delete record from child
  with out deleting corre ponding entry in  parent

 deleting record - 501 in COURSE;

first
 delete 501 from STUDENT;

 
you cannot insert 501 in student

with 501 in course;
